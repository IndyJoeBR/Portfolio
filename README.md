That is Old Dungeons and Dragons.

This one page RPG based on the brilliant **1 Pot RPG** designed by Duncan Young (2003); a single page role-playing game
based on what people now call Old Dungeons and Dragons.

**The Idea**
Instead of having a single paper page which contained your character and the rules, Java and JavaFX are used to create
the character sheet, allow the character to be designed and leveled, and all the dice can be rolled directly from the
character sheet.

**Changes from 1 Pot RPG**
I disagreed with some of the material in 1 Pot RPG and made those changes.  One such change was adding equipment.  It is,
primarily, for flavor.  But the intent is as the character levels, his equipment would automatically upgrade.

##This is a work in progress
